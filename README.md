# Hello, World!
Thanks for visiting my first C# repository!

The idea behind this repository is to expose and share my progress in C# and .NET development.

I'll be using the Foundational C# with Microsoft certification content to produce my code. You can access this free and valuable content in https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/.

After development basic console apps, I'll move forward to API development.
Hope to see you around.
